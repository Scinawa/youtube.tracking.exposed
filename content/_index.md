### 2020 Work in progress

* The year we have begun, we saw a debate and articles on academic research using API or non-logged profiles. We were happy because, finally, someone acknowledges that you can't investigate algorithms without a passive scraper, which is precisely what we do, and we hope to be used by researchers.
* Keep improving visualization in personal page.
* We already collect advertising information, but we don't display they yet!
* Compare video from the same [Author](/author).

### 2019 Completed components

* Working browser extension capable of copying the YouTube pages: [Chrome store,](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yttrex/kbbgjcgdcibilpahljnlejefcehbljnd) and [Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yttrex/).
* Release a simple API without any interface, to let researchers and developers experiment with the tool, check our [API documentation](/api-documentation).
* Released a page with a summary of our [first experiments](/results),
* Give control: a supported can create private group, tag their contributions, and remove any evidence they don't want to preserve.
* [public stats](/impact).
