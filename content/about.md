## When

The 1st of July 2018 the first commit on the [github repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex). The idea was to release the tool alongside an analysis on YouTube personalization algorithm before the midterm US elections.
first lesson: *your partner might have difficulties in implementing methodologies*. In 2019:

  * With the Italian Pirate Party, we elaborate a way to address the current issue felt by the [YouTuber's community](/seeyou).
  * In University of Amsterdam Summer School 2019, we finally coordinate [our first test](/results).
  * In University of Amsterdam Winter School 2020, we tested a [new method](/trexit).

And around the end of October 2019 we had enough stable functionality to release our stable beta version, in March 2020 we'll release our first [public appearance with weTEST#1](/wetest/1).
