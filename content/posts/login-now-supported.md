    title="This quick test allow you to compare how people logged off from youtube get a broader spectrum of contextual recommendation, rather than the personalized. To run this test, we installed Brave browser. Brave is derived from Chrome, contains adblocker by default, but the good thing is that normally nobody has it on their computer so we can be sure there are not cookies, trackers, and especially is not login in YouTube. To run this test, all these tracks should be clean."

Each violet bubble in the center represents one of the video suggested. They are few, but share many links, because most of the suggestions are the same among all the observers.
This is a starting condition: how users gets treated when Google doesn't know anything about a profile. Of course, they always know something (location of the connection, operating system model, default language, browser version). We tried to reduce these differences, to have something similar to a *non-personalized* algorithm stage. **You might expect this!** the large majority of the suggestions are shared among the users, because the data points usable by Google to personalize the suggestions are reduced.
