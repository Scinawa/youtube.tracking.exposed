{{<colorblock text="This service isn't ready yet, despite there is an API">}}

<p>
    The interface have been developed as part of the <a href="/seeyou">SeeYou</a>, an experiment on building a Youtube(r) labor union. Few weeks after that path begun, other two (unrelated) initiatives show up: 
    <a href="https://fairtube.com">FairTube</a>, and 
    <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Worker Coalition</a>. 
    <br><br>
    We should engineer a decent interface and UX. If you've features in mind or skill to share, feel free to connect with our <a href="https://github.com/tracking-exposed/youtube.tracking.exposed/issues">issue tracker</a> ;)
